This performance testing project utilizes Apache JMeter, with test cases recorded through BlazeMeter. 
The testing applies four methods:
1. Load Testing
2. Soak Testing
3. Spike Testing
4. Stress Testing
   
Each method encompasses three test scenarios:
1. Logging in and browsing products
2. Opening the menu and adding products to the cart
3. Opening the shopping cart and checking out
   
The parameters used for configuring the tests are adjusted to reflect the actual time taken by each scenario
during execution and are aligned with the characteristics of each testing method.
